Abstract

Food fraud is the act of tampering with food products and ingredients for economic gain. This is done through substitution and addition followed by misrepresentation. Such cases have a significant impact on public health and the global economy. For example, the European horse meat scandal of 2013 used DNA analysis to reveal that in some cases nearly 100\% of the beef burger was actually horse meat. A more devastating case is that of the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, where milk, infant formula, and other food ingredients had been adulterated with melamine. Out of an estimated 294.000 victims, 54.000 babies were hospitalized and 6 died from getting kidney stones and severe kidney damage. As a result of many such cases, public interest in food authentication has risen and the field is growing rapidly. More specifically, honey as a natural and high value product is subject to adulteration and many types of fraud.
