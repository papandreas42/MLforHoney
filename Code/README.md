# MLforHoney
This was my undergraduate thesis. We used two methodologies to classify honey based on it's botanical origin. 

1. Wavelet and probabilistic modeling for feature extraction and Support vector machines for classification (up to 4 classes with up to 97.8% accuracy).
2. Convolutional neural networks (3 classes, 98.3% accuracy).

We are currently working on adding more classes.
